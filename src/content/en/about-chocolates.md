# Perfect taste

Our chocolate has a rich, tempting taste, it is entirely hand made with products of high quality! Chocovitsa chocolate contains 100% pure cocoa butter and has 100% natural ingredients, no palm oil and preservatives! They are free of soya lecithin, gluten and GMO products! Cocoa is directly supplied from small family farms in South America, and the melting sweet taste is coming only from raw cane sugar, supplied from Columbia and Mauritius island.

# Stylish and elegant look

Colourfull and modern, reshaping Bulgarian traditional embroidery in completely new way! Our chocolate bars are embraced in magnificient packaging, made by Bulgarian designers. We create both boutique series with limited edition and permanent collections. We all share the same love to the chocolate! Share the passion with us and start your own chocolate collection!

# Hand made in Bulgaria

From beans grinding to packaging printing it is all done in Bulgaria, in our hometown Plovdiv! We respect the traditional craft, which our partner Gaillot chocolate develops with lots of love in his family factory almost 7 years!
